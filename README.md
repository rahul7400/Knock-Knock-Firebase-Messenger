# Knock knock - Firebase Messenger App 2018
A messenger app is **any app that enables a private messaging function between two or more people**. With more and more messenger apps popping up every day, this type of technology is quickly becoming the most popular way to send text-based messages, replacing SMS and MMS as the preference of most consumers.

This app was created in 2018 with the help of YouTube tutorials of [Akshay bhaiya](https://www.youtube.com/@TVACStudio/videos)
After completion of the tutorial I manipulated major codes of the app and made it an advance version of the app with more facilities like group chat, profile picture change, wall picture, status etc. and also changed the whole UI of the app by learning from here and there.
This was the first app of my life and this project helped me to learn full native android development.

This app is purely based on firebase. So to use the app you have to enable **Firebase realtime database, Firebase Storage, Firebase Authentication - with email** .

# Based on
Lapit chat app - https://github.com/yudikarma/Lapit---Android-Firebase-Chat-App
